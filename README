:: Jersey+Guice In-Memory Test Framework ::

Jersey provides a light-weight in-memory container for testing Jersey REST resources. However,
this container does not support testing resources that are wired using Google Guice. This
projects does provide a basic implementation of a Jersey in-memory container that support
testing Guice-wired REST resources. In addition, the test classes themselves can be injected
by the same Guice modules.

This project provides a simple CRUD-based rest resource with an associated jUnit test case.

    * BallsResource
    * BallsResourceTestCase

The resource is Guice-wired in the class ApplicationResourcesModule, and a backing BallRepository
class is also injected in the test case to demonstrate resource sharing between jUnit test and
resource implementation.

The application is packaged as a WAR, and by running

    > mvn jetty:run

The actual resource can be tested using, for example, Curl:

    > curl -v -X POST -d "color=red" http://localhost:8080/example/rest/balls
    > curl -v http://localhost:8080/example/rest/balls/1
    > curl -v -X PUT -d "color=green" http://localhost:8080/example/rest/balls/1

Enjoy, and please contact me for questions.
